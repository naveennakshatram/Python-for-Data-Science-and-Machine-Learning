🧠 What is Scikit-learn?

    Imagine a toolbox full of smart tools 🧰

    Want to teach your computer how to tell cats and dogs apart? 🐱🐶

    Or predict house prices? 🏠

    Or group fruits by shape? 🍎🍌

    🎯 Scikit-learn has ready-made tools to help with all that!

    ✅ You don’t need to build ML from scratch.

    ✅ You just import, feed the data, and let it learn!


📦 What Can You Do With Scikit-learn?

| Task                    | What it does                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classification** 🐱🐶 | Classify things into groups (like spam vs. not)    |
| **Regression** 📈       | Predict numbers (like price, temperature)          |
| **Clustering** 🧺       | Group similar items (like customers or animals)    |
| **Model Selection** 🔀  | Choose the best model or tune it                   |
| **Preprocessing** 🧼    | Clean/prepare data (like scaling, converting text) |
